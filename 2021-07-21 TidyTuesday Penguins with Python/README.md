# 2021-07-21 TidyTuesday Penguins with Python
 
In this session, I will introduce Tidy Tuesday. [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a weekely social data project in R from the R4DS (R for Data Science) online learning community. Users explore a new dataset each week and share their findings on Twitter with #TidyTuesday.

There is a nice [dashboard](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/tidy-tuesday.html) to show all #TidyTuesday tweets. Have a look as they often share GitHub repository too. A great way of learning new languages!

We will explore Penguins data from the Tidy Tuesday but using **Python**. We will continue to explore libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Scipy and Sklearn.

The session will be a hands on walk through lasting 45 minutes to an hour and is suitable for all abilities.
