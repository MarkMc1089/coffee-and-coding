# Coffee and Coding

---

### Introduction

This publically accessible repository will hold all materials for Coffee and Coding sessions held by the NHS Business Services Authority.

The goal of these sessions is to provide a relaxed environment to share new skills and encourage people to pick up the keyboard and learn to code. The sessions will last 45 minutes to 1 hour and should include some kind of hands on code for others to try out your material.

### Tools

We will utilise [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sfdsa/HEAD) as a free online interactive environment to execute code in online. If you are playing along, please launch a JupyterLab instance [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/nhsbsa%2Finsight%2Fshared%2Fcoffee-and-coding/master?urlpath=lab).
