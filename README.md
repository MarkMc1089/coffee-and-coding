# Coffee and Coding

This publically accessible repository will hold all materials for Coffee and Coding sessions held by the NHS Business Services Authority.

The goal of these sessions is to provide a relaxed environment to share new skills and encourage people to pick up the keyboard and learn to code. The sessions will last ~ 30 minutes and should include some kind of hands on coding for others to try out your material.

We will utilise https://cocalc.com/ as a free online environment for people to code along in. It has the benefit of kernels for both R and Python and does not require any sign up.

We are aiming to have our first session in June and are actively looking for volunteers to plan and host future sessions.

When adding new content please:

- Use branching (create a branch and submit a merge request for approval when you are finished)
- Follow the naming convention for your session's folder (`YYYYMMDD Session Name`)
- Include a `README.md` for your session to introduce it (+ any slides that you use)
- Include code to play along in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` files render as HTML so look better than `.R` or `.py`)
