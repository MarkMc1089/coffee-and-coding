# 2021-10-20 R Markdown and Official Statistics

Coffee and Coding: R Markdown

In this session we'll look at reproducible analytical pipelines, R Markdown, and how we use these in Official Statistics.

We'll create our own dynamic HTML document that updates depending on our inputs and demonstrate how to quickly automate menial manual tasks. We'll use packages such as dplyr and ggplot to create a simple report and even touch upon `for` loops!
