# 2021-08-25 Exploring the Titanic in R

Coffee and Coding: Exploring the Titanic in R
 
In this session we'll explore some common R libraries to help with exploratory data analysis, such as dplyr and ggplot using the Titanic Passenger Survival dataset.

The session will be a hands-on exploration of the data, including how to wrangle data, create new features and visualise the results.

It takes place on 25th August from 10am.
